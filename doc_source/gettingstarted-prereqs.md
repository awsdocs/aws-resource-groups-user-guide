# Prerequisites for working with AWS Resource Groups<a name="gettingstarted-prereqs"></a>

Before you get started working with resource groups, be sure you have an active AWS account with existing resources and appropriate rights to tag resources and create groups\.

## Sign up for AWS<a name="gettingstarted-prereqs-signup"></a>

If you do not have an AWS account, complete the following steps to create one\.

**To sign up for an AWS account**

1. Open [https://portal\.aws\.amazon\.com/billing/signup](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup)\.

1. Follow the online instructions\.

   Part of the sign\-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad\.

   When you sign up for an AWS account, an *AWS account root user* is created\. The root user has access to all AWS services and resources in the account\. As a security best practice, [assign administrative access to an administrative user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html), and use only the root user to perform [tasks that require root user access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.html)\.

## Create resources<a name="gettingstarted-prereqs-create"></a>

You can create an empty resource group, but won't be able to perform any tasks on resource group members until there are resources in the group\. For more information about the supported resource types, see [Resource types you can use with AWS Resource Groups and Tag Editor](supported-resources.md)\.

## Set up permissions<a name="gettingstarted-prereqs-permissions"></a>

To make full use of Resource Groups and Tag Editor, you might need additional permissions to tag resources or to see a resource's tag keys and values\. These permissions fall into the following categories: 
+ Permissions for individual services so that you can tag resources from those services and include them in resource groups\.
+ Permissions that are required to use the Tag Editor console
+ Permissions that are required to use the AWS Resource Groups console and API\. 

If you are an administrator, you can provide permissions for your users by creating policies through the AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) service\. You first create your principals, such as IAM roles or users, or associate external identities with your AWS environment using a service like AWS IAM Identity Center \(successor to AWS Single Sign\-On\)\. Then you apply policies with the permissions that your users need\. For information about creating and attaching IAM policies, see [Working with policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/ManagingPolicies.html)\.

### Permissions for individual services<a name="rg-perms-individual-services"></a>

**Important**  
This section describes permissions that are required if you want to tag resources from other service consoles and APIs, and add those resources to resource groups\.

As described in [What are resource groups?](resource-groups.md#resource-groups-intro), each resource group represents a collection of resources of specified types that share one or more tag keys or values\. To add tags to a resource, you need the permissions required for the service to which the resource belongs\. For example, to tag Amazon EC2 instances, your must have permissions to the tagging actions in that service's API, such as those listed in the [Amazon EC2 User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html#Using_Tags_CLI)\.

To make full use of the Resource Groups feature, you need other permissions that allow you to access a service's console and interact with the resources there\. For examples of such policies for Amazon EC2, see [Example policies for working in the Amazon EC2 console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-policies-ec2-console.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

### Required permissions for Resource Groups and Tag Editor<a name="gettingstarted-prereqs-permissions-te"></a>

To use Resource Groups and Tag Editor, the following permissions must be added to a user's policy statement in IAM\. You can add either AWS\-managed policies that are maintained and kept up\-to\-date by AWS, or you can create and maintain your own custom policy\.

#### Using AWS managed policies for Resource Groups and Tag Editor permissions<a name="prereqs-permissions-managedpolicies"></a>

AWS Resource Groups and Tag Editor support the following AWS managed policies that you can use to provide a predefined set of permissions to your users\. You can attach these managed policies to any user, role or group just as you would any other policy that you create\.

**[ResourceGroupsandTagEditorReadOnlyAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ResourceGroupsandTagEditorReadOnlyAccess)**  
This policy grants the attached IAM role or user permission to call the read\-only operations for both Resource Groups and Tag Editor\. To read a resource's tags, you must also have permissions for that resource through a separate policy \(see the following Important note\)\.

**[ResourceGroupsandTagEditorFullAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ResourceGroupsandTagEditorFullAccess)**  
This policy grants the attached IAM role or user permission to call any Resource Groups operation and the read and write tag operations in Tag Editor\. To read or write a resource's tags, you must also have permissions for that resource through a separate policy \(see the following Important note\)\.

**Important**  
The two previous policies grant permission to call the Resource Groups and Tag Editor operations and use those consoles\. For Resource Groups operations, those policies are sufficient and grant all the permissions needed to work with any resource in the Resource Groups console\.   
However, for tagging operations and the Tag Editor console, permissions are more granular\. You must have permissions not only to invoke the operation, but also appropriate permissions to the specific resource whose tags you're trying to access\. To grant that access to the tags, you must also attach one of the following policies:  
The AWS\-managed policy [ReadOnlyAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadOnlyAccess) grants permissions to the read\-only operations for every service's resources\. AWS automatically keeps this policy up to date with new AWS services as they become available\.
Many services provide a service\-specific read\-only AWS\-managed policies that you can use to limit access to only the resources provided by that service\. For example, Amazon EC2 provides [AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess)\.
You could create your own policy that grants access to only the very specific read\-only operations for the few services and resources you want your users to access\. This policy use either an "allow list" strategy or a deny list strategy\.  
An allow list strategy takes advantage of the fact that access is denied by default until you ***explicitly allow*** it in a policy\. So you can use a policy like the following example:  

  ```
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [ "resource-groups:*" ],
              "Resource": "arn:aws:resource-groups:*:123456789012:group/*"
          }
      ]
  }
  ```
Alternatively, you could use a "deny list" strategy that allows access to all resources except those that you explicitly block\.  

  ```
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Deny",
               "Action": [ "resource-groups:*" ],
              "Resource": "arn:aws:resource-groups:*:123456789012:group/*"
          }
      ]
  }
  ```

#### Adding Resource Groups and Tag Editor permissions manually<a name="prereqs-permissions-manualadd"></a>
+ `resource-groups:*` \(This permission allows all Resource Groups actions\. If you instead want to restrict actions that are available to a user, you can replace the asterisk with a [specific Resource Groups action](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_awsresourcegroups.html), or to a comma\-separated list of actions\)
+ `cloudformation:DescribeStacks`
+ `cloudformation:ListStackResources`
+ `tag:GetResources`
+ `tag:TagResources`
+ `tag:UntagResources`
+ `tag:getTagKeys`
+ `tag:getTagValues`
+ `resource-explorer:*`

To use Resource Groups and Tag Editor in the console, you also need permission to run the `resource-groups:ListGroupResources` action\. This permission is necessary for listing available resource types in the current Region\. Using policy conditions with `resource-groups:ListGroupResources` is not currently supported\.

### Granting permissions for using AWS Resource Groups and Tag Editor<a name="gettingstarted-prereqs-permissions-howto"></a>

To add a policy for using AWS Resource Groups and Tag Editor to a user, do the following\.

1. Open the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**\.

1. Find the user to whom you want to grant AWS Resource Groups and Tag Editor permissions\. Choose the user's name to open the user properties page\.

1. Choose **Add permissions**\.

1. Choose **Attach existing policies directly**\.

1. Choose **Create policy**\.

1. On the **JSON** tab, paste the following policy statement\.

   ```
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "resource-groups:*",
           "cloudformation:DescribeStacks",
           "cloudformation:ListStackResources",
           "tag:GetResources",
           "tag:TagResources",
           "tag:UntagResources",
           "tag:getTagKeys",
           "tag:getTagValues",
           "resource-explorer:*"
         ],
         "Resource": "*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
**Note**  
This example policy statement grants permissions only for AWS Resource Groups and Tag Editor actions\. It does not allow access to AWS Systems Manager tasks in the AWS Resource Groups console\. For example, this policy does not grant permissions for you to use Systems Manager Automation commands\. To perform Systems Manager tasks on resource groups, you must have Systems Manager permissions attached to your policy \(such as `ssm:*`\)\. For more information about granting access to Systems Manager, see [Configuring access to Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-access.html) in the *AWS Systems Manager User Guide*\.

1. Choose **Review policy**\.

1. Give the new policy a name and description\. \(for example, `AWSResourceGroupsQueryAPIAccess`\)\.

1. Choose **Create policy**\.

1. Now that the policy is saved in IAM, you can attach it to other users\. For more information about how to add a policy to a user, see [Adding permissions by attaching policies directly to the user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_change-permissions.html#by-direct-attach-policy) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

### Learn more about AWS Resource Groups authorization and access control<a name="rg-perms-iam"></a>

Resource Groups supports the following\.
+ **Action\-based policies\.** For example, you can create a policy that allows users to perform [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/APIReference/API_ListGroups.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/APIReference/API_ListGroups.html) operations, but no others\.
+ **Resource\-level permissions\.** Resource Groups supports using [ARNs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) to specify individual resources in the policy\.
+ **Authorization based on tags\.** Resource Groups supports using resource tags in the condition of a policy\. For example, you can create a policy that allows Resource Groups users full access to a group that you have tagged\.
+ **Temporary credentials\.** Users can assume a role with a policy that allows AWS Resource Groups operations\.

Resource Groups doesn't support resource\-based policies\.

Resource Groups doesn't use any service\-linked roles\.
