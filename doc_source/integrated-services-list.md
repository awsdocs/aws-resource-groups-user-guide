You can use the following AWS services with AWS Resource Groups\. 


****  

| AWS service | Using with Resource Groups  | 
| --- | --- | 
|  [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/) – Create resource groups in AWS CloudFormation by using a stack template\.  |  Provision and organize AWS resources at the same time\. Organize resources by tags\. Organize resources from another stack\. Gather insights on your AWS resources in resource groups using Amazon CloudWatch or take operational actions using AWS Systems Manager\. For more information, see [ResourceGroups resource type reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/AWS_ResourceGroups.html) in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide*\.  | 
|  [CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/) – Capture all resource group actions using AWS CloudTrail\.  |  Capture information about actions performed on your resource groups including details like who performed the action \(IAM user or role, or an AWS service\), when the action was performed, where the action occurred \(the source IP address\) and more\. These records can then be used for analysis or to trigger follow\-up actions\. For more information, see [Viewing events with CloudTrail Event history](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events.html)\.  | 
|  [Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html) – Enable real\-time monitoring of your AWS resources and the applications you run on AWS\.  |  Focus your view to display metrics and alarms from a single resource group\.

For more information, see [Working with dedicated hosts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/how-dedicated-hosts-work.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances\.*  | 
| [Amazon EC2 capacity reservations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-capacity-reservations.html) – Reserve capacity for your Amazon EC2 instances to be used when you need it\. You can specify attributes for the capacity reservation so that it only works with Amazon EC2 instances that launch with matching attributes\. |  Launch your Amazon EC2 instances into resource groups that contain one or more capacity reservations\. If the group doesn't have a capacity reservation with matching attributes and available capacity for a requested instance, the instance runs as an on\-demand instance\. If you later add a matching capacity reservation to the targeted group, the instance is automatically matched with and moved into the reserved capacity\. For more information, see [Work with Capacity Reservation groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/capacity-reservations-using.html#create-cr-group) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances\.*  |

|  [AWS Service Catalog AppRegistry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/appregistry.html) – Define and manage your applications and their metadata\.  |  When you create an application in AWS Service Catalog AppRegistry, that service automatically creates an resource group for that application\. The application resource group is a collection of all of the resources in your application\. The service also creates a AWS CloudFormation stack\-based resource group for every stack associated with the application\. For more information, see [Using AppRegistry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/appregistry.html) in the *AWS Service Catalog Administrator Guide*\.  |
