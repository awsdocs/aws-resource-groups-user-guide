## AWS managed policies available for use with AWS Resource Groups<a name="arg-reference-managed-policies"></a>

[AWS\-managed IAM permission policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies) enable you to grant pre\-configured permissions to the IAM principals, such as roles and users, in your account\. AWS managed policies are tested and adhere to best practice recommendations, so you can reliably use them in the scenarios for which they're define\. As new resource types are supported as members of resource groups, and as new resource types support tagging, AWS automatically updates these policies to support them\. You don't need to do anything\.

The following table lists the AWS\-managed IAM permission policies available for you to use to grant permissions to AWS Resource Groups\.
